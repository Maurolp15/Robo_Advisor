## Robo Advisor

My name is Oscar Lopez, a University of Miami FinTech Bootcamp student. 

In this activity, I was task by a prominent retirement plan company with creating a Robo Advisor that could be used by existing and prospect costumers, specially by engaging young people, to get investment portfolio recommendation for retirement.

For this activity, I used Amazon Web Services by defining the Amazon Lex with a single intent, build and tested the Robo Advisor with the files given to me, then I enhanced it with an Amazon Lambda Function using Phyton skills. 

I really enjoyed this activity while I applied the different tools seen during the past week in class. I used the exercises done in class and had some help from the professor to overcome the different challenges.
